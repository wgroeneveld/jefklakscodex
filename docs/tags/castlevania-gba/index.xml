      <description>As the hunt continues, from Aria of Sorrow to the beginning of Castlevania&amp;rsquo;s appearance on the GBA, Circle of the Moon, I have the uneasy feeling that my whip offers less solace in this scarier version of the castle. The encounter with an earth demon in the very first minutes acts as a warning for the rest of the game: be prepared to see YOU DIED a lot! Nathan Graves has to free his master from the clutches of - you guessed it - Dracula and partners, on the way avoiding the increasingly jealous Hugh Baldwin, the son of his master.</description>

      <description>Calling Aria of Sorrow the best handheld Castlevania is quite a bold statement: they&amp;rsquo;re all great in their own way. But after replaying this again (and again&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ve made up my mind: it is the best Castlevania - period. It&amp;rsquo;s the second best Gameboy Advance title of all times according to IGN. Yes, I am insinuating it&amp;rsquo;s better than Symphony of the night. And yes, I know of the inverted castle&amp;rsquo;s greatness and the rip-off in Harmony of Dissonance.</description>
