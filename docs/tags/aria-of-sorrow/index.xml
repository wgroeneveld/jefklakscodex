      <description>Calling Aria of Sorrow the best handheld Castlevania is quite a bold statement: they&amp;rsquo;re all great in their own way. But after replaying this again (and again&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ve made up my mind: it is the best Castlevania - period. It&amp;rsquo;s the second best Gameboy Advance title of all times according to IGN. Yes, I am insinuating it&amp;rsquo;s better than Symphony of the night. And yes, I know of the inverted castle&amp;rsquo;s greatness and the rip-off in Harmony of Dissonance.</description>

      <description>Portrait of Ruin is the second Nintendo DS Castlevania game. Maybe, if Komani thinks it&#39;ll be worthwile, a third one will follow, since there have been three Castlevania games released for the predecessor the Gameboy Advance. All excellent Handheld Metroidvania games, but which one excels at what? A short overview would be handy indeed. Well here you go! Gameboy Advance Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance  Harmony of Dissonance was actually the second Castlevania game to be released on the GBA.</description>
