      <description>As the hunt continues, from Aria of Sorrow to the beginning of Castlevania&amp;rsquo;s appearance on the GBA, Circle of the Moon, I have the uneasy feeling that my whip offers less solace in this scarier version of the castle. The encounter with an earth demon in the very first minutes acts as a warning for the rest of the game: be prepared to see YOU DIED a lot! Nathan Graves has to free his master from the clutches of - you guessed it - Dracula and partners, on the way avoiding the increasingly jealous Hugh Baldwin, the son of his master.</description>

      <description>Calling Aria of Sorrow the best handheld Castlevania is quite a bold statement: they&amp;rsquo;re all great in their own way. But after replaying this again (and again&amp;hellip;) I&amp;rsquo;ve made up my mind: it is the best Castlevania - period. It&amp;rsquo;s the second best Gameboy Advance title of all times according to IGN. Yes, I am insinuating it&amp;rsquo;s better than Symphony of the night. And yes, I know of the inverted castle&amp;rsquo;s greatness and the rip-off in Harmony of Dissonance.</description>

      <title>Castlevania Portrait of Ruin Review</title>

      <description>Castlevania games tend to pop up each year on Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s Handheld platform. The last entries: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow, followed the story of Soma, who mysteriously inherited Dracula&amp;rsquo;s dark abilities. Forget about all that, and the soul harvesting system. Portrait of Ruin is the spiritual successor of Castlevania Bloodlines on the SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis. Jonathan Morris is the son of Bloodlines&amp;rsquo; whip-equipped hero. PoR takes place during or just after the second World War.</description>

      <description>Portrait of Ruin is the second Nintendo DS Castlevania game. Maybe, if Komani thinks it&#39;ll be worthwile, a third one will follow, since there have been three Castlevania games released for the predecessor the Gameboy Advance. All excellent Handheld Metroidvania games, but which one excels at what? A short overview would be handy indeed. Well here you go! Gameboy Advance Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance  Harmony of Dissonance was actually the second Castlevania game to be released on the GBA.</description>
