      <description>Remember the Animal Crossing: Wild World Adventure Blog post? Well, after a very long wait, the newest installment of Animal Crossing, called New Horizons, finally arrived on the Nintendo Switch. For the first time since the original installment on the Gamecube, it has come back to home consoles! It only seemed appropriate to continue the AC adventure blog, from way back in 2006, to see what kind of trouble my character would get himself into while trying to build a community in the new Island.</description>

      <description>The Cornimer is Here! [ Date: 09/10/2006 | top ]
Yes! The Acorn festival starts today! I managed to grab 15 acorns as quickly as I could, excited to see the legendary Cornimer pop up next to my Town Hall. He seems to like me so far, I received a Mush Chair and End Table in exchange for his acorns. Pfew, luckily I threw the rotten ones away. Oh yeah, and it&amp;rsquo;s Drift&amp;rsquo;s Birthday.</description>
