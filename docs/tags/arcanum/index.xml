      <title>Arcanum: Magick VS Tech</title>

      <description>First things first: you are not reading this wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s magick and not magic. In the world of Arcanum, that is. There&amp;rsquo;s also no such thing as mana or spellbooks. Every single spell you learn comes trough {+SPs+) (Skill Points) which you&amp;rsquo;ll have to invest into several magickal realms. A little bit like Diablo 2, except the fact that once you&amp;rsquo;ve put 1 point into it, you can&amp;rsquo;t raise it further to increase the power.</description>

      <description>Party Numer ONE - November 2004
 Level - 25.
Laprovski - Male Dwarf - Raised by Monks
Skills - Technologist: firearms, gunsmithy, electricity &amp;amp; explosives
Stats - First PER Second INT Third DEX After a few tries, this dwarf managed to get himself to Tarant. There, the beautiful game acutally started with so many options - especially for technology! The dozens of shops give you plenty of possibilities and you&amp;rsquo;ll never run out of your own gadgets.</description>

      <title>Arcanum: the Gunslinger</title>

      <description>Overview
All right, you want yourself a cool character with even cooler guns. The problem is: technology is not that easy in Arcanum. Especially all the different schemes, guns, carrying the bullets, and so on. Would you like to make a backup plan, like throwing or a bow? Or would you just like to grab yourself an axe and whack the enemy when you run out of bullets? Or would you go running and rely on your followers?</description>

      <title>Arcanum: the Review</title>

      <description>Hooray hooray for classic urgh-so-bad-graphics-but-so-good-gameplay RPG-games like this! Arcanum is without a doubt the best game Troika ever made, and that deserves something extra. Like a review and a nice collection of screenshots, or something similar. Enough introduction, grab a gun and shoot! Or pick a spell and cast, if you will.
What&amp;rsquo;s going on, George?
Finetuning has never been more fun
As some of you probably already know, this is a very strange game.</description>

      <title>RPG Concepts: NPCS</title>

      <description>Watch the NPC Reaction video tests! &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
An NPC is basically a character not controlled by the player, who can be of great importance during the many main or side quests. NPCs vary in importance and placement: they can either be annoying and useless or interesting and useful. Many Role-playing games only give the most important NPCs something useful to say or do. Talking to other characters makes no sense since they only answer with one of the standard sentences: &amp;ldquo;oh, you&amp;rsquo;re the princess!</description>
