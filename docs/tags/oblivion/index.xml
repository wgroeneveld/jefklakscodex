      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure most of you know the feeling. A new game has been recently announced, maybe with some additional gameplay footage or early concept art. You knew from that point on, the game had to be great, no mistake made. A couple of logical reasons could possibly be:
 The title is a sequel to your favourite game all time The title comes from a well known and loved development studio Both title and studio are completely new or unknown, but the genre is to your liking None of the above apply.</description>

      <description>Watch the NPC Reaction video tests! &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
An NPC is basically a character not controlled by the player, who can be of great importance during the many main or side quests. NPCs vary in importance and placement: they can either be annoying and usesless or interesting and useful. Many Roleplaying games only give the most important NPCs something useful to say or do. Talking to other characters makes no sense since they only answer with one of the standard sentences: &amp;ldquo;oh, you&amp;rsquo;re the princess!</description>
