      <description>What could possibly more fun than playing a PC game on your own? Why, cooperative gameplay mechanics of course! Every modern released game nowadays features at least one cooperative (co-op) game mode where you can play with your friends, mostly against the computer AI. Since this is part I, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Strategy games on the PC and its coopeartive capabilities.

      <description>Argh, my temple, all messed up! Poseidon likes to destroy all buildings I carefully planted down on the coast line because he&amp;rsquo;s cranky in the morning. Acually I did not do him a favour in the past few years and instead joined forces with one of the other major Greek Gods. What choice would you make? A couple of free superman-like heroes fighting side by side with your giant army, or a couple of free boats to roam and rule the sea?</description>
