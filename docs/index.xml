      <description>Skip to the Videos part!
Only the new and young generation of gamers might not be familiar with Apogee Software - that is, until one has read the article. Apogee, the legacy of shareware PC games. I remember everything like it was yesterday! Impatiently receiving my first oversized floppy disk containing a demo version of Cosmo&amp;rsquo;s little adventures, racing through the first few levels of Duke Nukem, defeating way too much zombies in Monster Bash, capturing the first castle in Mystic Towers, &amp;hellip; The video game company literally created the shareware distribution model using various monthly subscribed magazines and one free floppy which was without a doubt numberous times passed on.</description>

      <title>Arcanum: Magick VS Tech</title>

      <description>First things first: you are not reading this wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s magick and not magic. In the world of Arcanum, that is. There&amp;rsquo;s also no such thing as mana or spellbooks. Every single spell you learn comes trough {+SPs+) (Skill Points) which you&amp;rsquo;ll have to invest into several magickal realms. A little bit like Diablo 2, except the fact that once you&amp;rsquo;ve put 1 point into it, you can&amp;rsquo;t raise it furter ot increase the power.</description>

      <description>Party Numer ONE - November 2004
 Level - 25.
Laprovski - Male Dwarf - Raised by Monks
Skills - Technologist: firearms, gunsmithy, electricity &amp;amp; explosives
Stats - First PER Second INT Third DEX After a few tries, this dwarf managed to get himself to Tarant. There, the beautiful game acutally started with so many options - especially for technology! The dozens of shops give you plenty of possibilities and you&amp;rsquo;ll never run out of your own gadgets.</description>

      <title>Arcanum: the Gunslinger</title>

      <description>Overview
All right, you want yourself a cool character with even cooler guns. The problem is: technology is not that easy in Arcanum. Especially all the different schemes, guns, carrying the bullets, and so on. Would you like to make a backup plan, like throwing or a bow? Or would you just like to grab yourself an axe and whack the enemy when you run out of bullets? Or would you go running and rely on your followers?</description>

      <title>Arcanum: the Review</title>

      <description>Hooray hooray for classic urgh-so-bad-graphics-but-so-good-gameplay RPG-games like this! Arcanum is without a doubt the best game Troika ever made, and that deserves something extra. Like a review and a nice collection of screenshots, or something similar. Enough introduction, grab a gun and shoot! Or pick a spell and cast, if you will.
What&amp;rsquo;s going on, George?
Finetuning has never been more fun
As some of you probably already know, this is a very strange game.</description>

      <title>Arx Fatalis: the Review</title>

      <description>Not many first person action Roleplaying games are well known, except the Ultima Underground series and of course the Elder Scrolls games. FP RPGs date back from Wizardry, Eye of the Beholder and Might &amp;amp; Magic (see Roleplaying Concepts), but none of those games actually enable you to swing with a sword in a real time fashion. The Gothic games utilize the third person camera angle, so the only games which might get remotely close to being Arx Fatalis are Daggerfall/Morrowind and Ultima Underworld.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s modular Roleplaying game Neverwinter Nights 2 was released. NWN is well-known for its overwhelming amounth of fan-made modules and even whole Community Packs. This is the result of BioWare&amp;rsquo;s powerful Aurora Engine toolkit, which came packaged with the game. So actually it&amp;rsquo;s not that strange the game gets so much attention - take a look at UT2004&amp;rsquo;s numberous modifications or Total Conversions: with UnrealEd this is all possible.</description>

      <description>Ever wondered whatever the heck those crazy Arcane spellcasters say every time they unleash one of their spells upon you? It&#39;s actually very simple and stands for the chosen spell&#39;s spell school (abjuration, evocation, ...). Male and female voices are of course different, and the pronunciations vary too sometimes (Vita Mortis [Carero]/[Calia]?). All formulaes are actually Latin, and Latin is often pronounced differently depending on the dialect. Here is a quick overview:  1.</description>

      <description>Party Number TWO - 06 Jan. 2006 (download link no longer available) Party Numer TWO - 06 Jan. 2006   Attitude: Xandarr, my main character. I decided to create a melee divine spellcaster, for the very first time, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Arcane Magic way too much. I ended up with three members who are able to cast divinity spells, which is awesome. Xandarr is also the main melee mob killer, besides Keldorn.</description>

      <description>Lots of misunderstanding exist for breaking through the spell protections of high level spell casting creatures. This guide is an almost exact copy of zvijers guide at the gone forgotten wars forum, also carried on by &amp;ldquo;The Hero&amp;rsquo;s Guide to a Successful adventure&amp;rdquo;. I found this to be very informative and vital for solo runs. The strategies explain mage protections in weimer&amp;rsquo;s Tactics modification.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting fairly tired of defending Arcanum on various cough, console lovers message boards and against friends. Everybody seems to prefer Oblivion-style Roleplaying gameplay mechanics. Fine by me, but don&amp;rsquo;t try to piss RPG Codex members and me off by complaining about the bug fest in Troika&amp;rsquo;s games. During my more than 5 playthroughs (admittedly never got to the finish, fooling around with different characters is even funnier), I never encountered a single &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Ah, 2D platformers. This genre disappeared after the DOS era on the PC. Also the consoles liked more the 3D platform games like hundreds of Mario 64 clones. There was almost never an attempt to revive the classic 2D sidescrolling action and add a few modern elements to it. Except for Monolith Productions of course! We know Monolith mostly from First Person games like the recent F.E.A.R. and of course the No One Lives Forever series.</description>

      <title>Castlevania Portrait of Ruin Review</title>

      <description>Castlevania games tend to pop up each year on Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s Handheld platform. The last entries: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow, followed the story of Soma, who mysteriously inherited Dracula&amp;rsquo;s dark abilities. Forget about all that, and the soul harvesting system. Portrait of Ruin is the spiritual successor of Castlevania Bloodlines on the SEGA MegaDrive/Genesis. Jonathan Morris is the son of Bloodlines&amp;rsquo; whip-equipped hero. PoR takes place during or just after the second World War.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Platform games, one of the most dominant game genres in gaming history. They spawned a whole lot of spin-off series (run-and-gun, platform puzzles, Apogee&amp;rsquo;s shareware system, Mario 64&amp;rsquo;s 3D platform debut). Platform gaming has been the dominant type on every gaming platform for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Cornimer is Here! [ Date: 09/10/2006 | top ]
Yes! The Acorn festival starts today! I managed to grab 15 acorns as quickly as I could, excited to see the legendary Cornimer pop up next to my Town Hall. He seems to like me so far, I received a Mush Chair and End Table in exchange for his acorns. Pfew, luckily I threw the rotten ones away. Oh yeah, and it&amp;rsquo;s Drift&amp;rsquo;s Birthday.</description>

      <description>About the Codex Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jefklak/Wouter and you&amp;rsquo;re looking at &amp;ldquo;Jefklak&amp;rsquo;s Codex&amp;rdquo;, a dedicated and highly opinionated website about nostalgic games. The word nostalgic should be emphasized here. I grew up with a Gameboy between my hands and PC RPG games burnt into my retina. That healthy cocktail left a lasting impression - and netted me the Codex (and glasses).
The Codex has a long history, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt the need to proclaim my definitive game of each generation.</description>
