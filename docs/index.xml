      <description>Skip to the Videos part!
Only the new and young generation of gamers might not be familiar with Apogee Software - that is, until one has read the article. Apogee, the legacy of shareware PC games. I remember everything like it was yesterday! Impatiently receiving my first oversized floppy disk containing a demo version of Cosmo&amp;rsquo;s little adventures, racing through the first few levels of Duke Nukem, defeating way too much zombies in Monster Bash, capturing the first castle in Mystic Towers, &amp;hellip; The video game company literally created the shareware distribution model using various monthly subscribed magazines and one free floppy which was without a doubt numberous times passed on.</description>

      <title>Arcanum: Magick VS Tech</title>
      <link>https://jefklakscodex.com/articles/arcanum-magick-vs-tech/</link>

      <description>First things first: you are not reading this wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s magick and not magic. In the world of Arcanum, that is. There&amp;rsquo;s also no such thing as mana or spellbooks. Every single spell you learn comes trough {+SPs+) (Skill Points) which you&amp;rsquo;ll have to invest into several magickal realms. A little bit like Diablo 2, except the fact that once you&amp;rsquo;ve put 1 point into it, you can&amp;rsquo;t raise it furter ot increase the power.</description>

      <title>Arcanum: the Gunslinger</title>

      <description>Overview
All right, you want yourself a cool character with even cooler guns. The problem is: technology is not that easy in Arcanum. Especially all the different schemes, guns, carrying the bullets, and so on. Would you like to make a backup plan, like throwing or a bow? Or would you just like to grab yourself an axe and whack the enemy when you run out of bullets? Or would you go running and rely on your followers?</description>

      <title>Arcanum: the Review</title>
      <link>https://jefklakscodex.com/articles/arcanum-review/</link>

      <description>Hooray hooray for classic urgh-so-bad-graphics-but-so-good-gameplay RPG-games like this! Arcanum is without a doubt the best game Troika ever made, and that deserves something extra. Like a review and a nice collection of screenshots, or something similar. Enough introduction, grab a gun and shoot! Or pick a spell and cast, if you will.
What&amp;rsquo;s going on, George?
Finetuning has never been more fun
As some of you probably already know, this is a very strange game.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Platform games, one of the most dominant game genres in gaming history. They spawned a whole lot of spin-off series (run-and-gun, platform puzzles, Apogee&amp;rsquo;s shareware system, Mario 64&amp;rsquo;s 3D platform debut). Platform gaming has been the dominant type on every gaming platform for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Cornimer is Here! [ Date: 09/10/2006 | top ]
Yes! The Acorn festival starts today! I managed to grab 15 acorns as quickly as I could, excited to see the legendary Cornimer pop up next to my Town Hall. He seems to like me so far, I received a Mush Chair and End Table in exchange for his acorns. Pfew, luckily I threw the rotten ones away. Oh yeah, and it&amp;rsquo;s Drift&amp;rsquo;s Birthday.</description>

      <description>About the Codex Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jefklak/Wouter and you&amp;rsquo;re looking at &amp;ldquo;Jefklak&amp;rsquo;s Codex&amp;rdquo;, a dedicated and highly opinionated website about nostalgic games. The word nostalgic should be emphasized here. I grew up with a Gameboy between my hands and PC RPG games burnt into my retina. That healthy cocktail left a lasting impression - and netted me the Codex (and glasses).
The Codex has a long history, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt the need to proclaim my definitive game of each generation.</description>
