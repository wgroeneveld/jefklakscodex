You're looking at Jefklak's (Retro [Game](/tags)) Codex, a dedicated and highly opinionated website about nostalgic games. A lovely mix between Nintendo handheld gaming love, '90s DOS games and old school PC RPGs that were an integral part of [my youth](/about). <br/>
That healthy cocktail left a lasting impression - and netted me the Codex (and glasses). A lot of articles have been carefully restored from the black depths of the Jefklak Archive for your entertainment. As [Deckard Cain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg) would have said it: **Stay Awhile and Listen**!
