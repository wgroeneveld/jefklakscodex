Remember the [Animal Crossing: Wild World Adventure Blog post](/articles/animalcrossing-wildworld/)? Well, after a _very_ long wait, the newest installment of Animal Crossing, called New Horizons, finally arrived on the Nintendo Switch. For the first time since the original installment on the Gamecube, it has come back to home consoles! It only seemed appropriate to continue the **AC adventure blog**, from way back in 2006, to see what kind of trouble my character would get himself into while trying to build a community in the new Island. 

### The town square is _finally_ finished!

I do not believe they call it the Major's house or the Town Hall this time, but rather Nook's Resident Services 'building'. In any case, gone are the pesky tent and the wooden planks that hurt the eyes. Instead, a nice paved square welcomes weekly visitors, such as Kicks, the guy who sells shoes. I wonder whether he will also settle down some day, like the clothing sisters did. I had to place their shop, and we're still out of bridges to build, which is higly annoying.

Five residents and counting! I managed to convince a dog to stay - he stopped by the place where peeps can set up their tent to visit Poezista. Now let's get rid of easter so I can dig up materials with confidence again, instead of finding eggs (that do bring in a nice amount of bells).

### Easter is (almost) upon us...

<div style="text-align: right;">[ Date: 05/04/2020 | <a href="#top">top</a> ]</div>

... And it proves to be hell on earth. It's raining balloon gifts, and they are all easter-flavored: a certain bunny hopped by and told me to nab as many hidden eggs as possible. Sometimes, a gift I shot down contained DIY recipes for those eggs. Don't you love seasonal presents? They can only be made/given in a certain time frame, and after the 12th of this month, it's game over for the easter bunny. I remember gathering acorns in [Wild World](/articles/animalcrossing-wildworld/) like it was yesterday, so naturally I set to work.

After decorating my head, my door, and all other inhabitants by forcing gifts upon them, I think I've had enough eggs for the week. The trouble is, they all take up inventory space - of course they do. There are air eggs (you shoot down), earth eggs (you dig up), leaf eggs (you shake down), water eggs (you fish out), and stone eggs (you shovel out). It's one big feast, and one big mess trying to manage item space. 

The most frustrating thing about the upcoming easter festivities is that my precious _clay_ resource does not appear as often as I would have liked because of those pesky stone eggs. Now I have to visit islands (thus gathering Nook Miles) to hit even more rocks. Yay!

### Even Guilliver is on Tech now

Yup, I came across that sleepyhead again. He landed on the beaches of _Poezista_, trying to message his comrades, using a modern tool no less. However, not only the reception is bad, but the thing was utterly broken. Guess what, I had to go on a hunt for resources! But first, clear out some inventory space please, because five broken parts need to be dug up somewhere in the area on the beach.

The guy was kind enough to send me a present via mail the day after. Not that I was really into the Tiki lady figurine that resembles a bobblehead, but hey: my tiny living room needed that piece of furniture to cheer up the place a bit. I hope that mortgage will be paid soon, maybe a bathroom won't be bad. I managed to craft myself a _shell rug_ using three giant clams I found on the beach, so that's not bad!

### Where's all that money at? DIY!

<div style="text-align: right;">[ Date: 01/04/2020 | <a href="#top">top</a> ]</div>

One of the coolest, and also annoying, additions to New Horizons is the Do It Yourself attitude. You can craft items (and even tools) yourself - oh sorry, scratch that (ha!): you **must** craft certain things yourself. Well, not entirely, Timmy also sells Flimsy Fishing Nets, but you don't exactly want to spend more than 400 bells on something you can whip up in a matter of... minutes? Shaking trees: branches, check. Hitting rocks: stones, check. My pockets are constantly full with garbage: soft wood, hard wood, stones, clay, the occasional golden nugget, ... 

Luckily, Tom Nook's Shack (that hopefully will get upgraded some day, they only sell shit over there!) is also willing to buy my handmade things. That's where things get interesting: once a day a certain DIY item is worth twice that price. And if that item is an umbrella you can easily make out of clumps of weed, it's time to pull some weeds!

I think I sold more than 20 umbrellas that day. It was a good day. My 189.000 bells loan got paid off quickly. Now I have a 345.000 bells loan... Ouch. The core of the game hasn't changed much: it's still a grueling grind, and it's still ever so lovely and addicting!
