### <a id="intro"></a>Introduction

I love [Wizardry 8](/tags/wizardry8) - I really do. I've been bragging about the game for years now to anyone willing to listen, and lately, I've been keen on replaying the whole game for old times sake - on a "real" retro Win98 PC. After _finally_ convincing my friend to install the game (he was looking for a big timesink. You've been warned), we were ready to go through it together/alone, since it's a single-player adventure. In the same fashion as the [BG2 Solo Blade Report](/articles/guides/bg2-solo-blade/), I thought it would be nice to do a short write-up after making a bit of progress. 

So, after spending the necessary hours being stuck in the character creation sheets - I really couldn't choose - this is the party I've decided to go for:

{{% dualscreens "/img/games/Wizardry8/playthrough/" "wiz8-party.jpg" "The starting party." "wiz8-inventory.jpg" "My Samurai doesn't let down." %}}

- Ninja: _Muesli_, Felpurr
- Lord: _Mielie_, Rawulf
- Bishop: _Christina_, Faerie
- Samurai: _Sharptooth_, Dracon
- Mage: _Santa_, Gnome
- Gadgeteer: _Wooly_, Mook

I originally wanted only four characters as experience points are precious and I like specialized classes in this game. But, since I'm playing for the first time with [Christan Coder's Mod v2](http://www.jeffludwig.com/wizardry8mod/), I thought a full party would be a good idea. I've played the vanilla version and with Flamestryke's New Mod v1.1. For this playthrough, a more balanced mod (Flamestryke's new items are crazy!) sounded good. I couldn't party with my favorite samurai/dracon, ninja/felpurr combo so what the heck. On to the adventure! If this is your first playthrough, read [the classes guide](/articles/guides/wizardry8-classes/) or [my wiz8 general tips](/articles/guides/wizardry8-tips/) (old but still relevant).

### <a id="monastery"></a>The Monastery


Right, our ship crashed. Correction: it was shot out of the sky! We're stranded on a foreign beach, at the entrance of a building that we later identify as a monastery. Let's get to it! Conveniently, a chest lies there waiting for us, stocked with random weapons and armor. Lovely. After trashing twenty or so crabs and fetching the _Cherry Bomb_ and Axe on top of the archipel, we carefully venture inside. Three green slimes greet us, but are no match to the blades of our Samurai and the shurikens of our Ninja. The starting weapons of some classes are quite powerful. A couple of dead rats and bats later, we encounter another version of the slime: a _Noxious Slime_. This time, the thing spits at us, and we can't reach it as fast as we'd like. The result? A dead Gadgeteer. Of course, I forgot to save my progress. A few curses later, I pressed _Start New Game_ again. Sigh. 

Next time, I'll keep my fingers positioned on top of `Q` (quicksave) and occasionally `CTRL+Q` (quickload) - and hopefully will not mix up both hotkeys. A second try did help with the slime, but my mage got overconfident, trying to cast a higher level _Frost_ than he'd probably be able to handle. *BOOM* - backfire. Shit. This time though, I knew what to do: `CTRL+Q`!

{{% dualscreens "/img/games/Wizardry8/playthrough/" "monastery-slime-death.jpg" "Noxious Slime: 1. Party: 0." "monastery-backfire-death.jpg" "Great, spell backfire: another death." %}}

After a business meeting with **Gregor** in the main hall (the deal fell through), we were well on our way to grab the _Safe Key_ by plucking at the skeleton head of the statue - that is, after getting rid of Gregor's little helpers, and they know how to bite (and gang up on us). I hope your party formation is in order! Okay, so we now have `6` portions of resurrection powder: three from the safe and three from the hidden waterfall place, after "sleeping with the fishes" near the iron bridge. I couldn't remember where to get the key for the "dangerous weapons", according to a cryptic Rapax note, but after a few minutes, I thought it must have been near Arnika itself. 

So, nothing much left to do than to clear out the Upper Monastery Floor - and meet another enemy type: bandits. We spot a shiny piece of samurai armor equipment, but it's sealed shut behind glass. Hmm... Should we "microwave" it, like how we got the chip for Wooly our Gadgie? It turns out that there's a key that unlocks a door in the Silent Room, where we can ring the monastery bells. Crank it all the way up and all the glass in the entire building breaks! Oh-oh... Luckily, the Higardi Monks have long been gone, and all that is left for us to do is to read their boring administration, grab all the spellbooks we can get our hands on (including a soon-to-be important note), and get the hell out of here.

Christina our Bishop is as crappy as can be expected from an untrained low-level Bishop. I already shiver when I think of the many hours of "exercise" (casting _Knock Knock_ in the Arnika vaults) I used to put into such builds. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that this time. Anyway, when entering a side chapel, suddenly, in a flash, a robot appears! Oh no, wait, it was waiting for us but it _disappears_ in a flash. We were impressed. But what to make of it? It seems that there's a race going on, a quest to "**ascend**", and for that, we need to be as "smart as the cosmic lords". How do we do that? By getting three important artifacts! The flags on the walls hint towards these, but other than that, there's not much here. We grab a few more unnecessary potions, Wooly's first gadget, spot more hidden piles of stones for Wooly's Omnigun, and get going by opening the front door.

### <a id="arnika"></a>(The Road to) Arnika

After a long, long road - basically a big slog - the most gruesome part of Wizardry 8 is finally over: the road from the Monastery to Arnika. A lot of people gave up on this road, and a lot of reloads were needed. Enemy mobs scale to your level, and if you camp too many times, multiple mobs will spawn and make your journey even more difficult. I managed to trash the rogues guarding the treasure fairly quickly, but after closing in on the abandoned house (housing a hidden portal), I got stumped myself. 

{{% dualscreens "/img/games/Wizardry8/playthrough/" "arnika-patrols.jpg" "So many nasty rogues out here!" "arnika-vi.jpg" "We rescued Vi!" %}}

Arnika itself isn't what it used to be: many people flet since the arrival of the _Dark Savant_. The bastard build a huge tower here, from where he shot down our ship. We can't seem to access it yet, but a shady looking character named _Myles_ reports on a kidnapping. Naturally, we comply, and temporarily accompany Myles to the location of the crime: another crashed ship, with a destroyed house. There, we rescue Vi from a bunch of angry droids, and we find another interesting part that might come in handy for Wooly our gadgeteer. 

In this game, you are nowhere safe, not even in He'Li's bar, not even in the rooms she rents, as another group of mercenaries were keen on stealing our money and shiny looking equipment. After stealing Antone's keycard, plundering the bank and getting every piece of useful information out of all NPCs, we prepare to leave for Trynton. Muesli, our Feline Ninja, "guarded" Myles' gear, as we politely asked both Myles and Vi to leave. _All your XP are belong to us!_ No, really, wee need it, desperately - especially after getting our butts kicked by a guardian golem in the vaults. The treasure was worthless. It was a sad day. Sharptooth got killed, and said _"next time, help me BEFORE I die!"_ after sprinkling him with our priceless resurrection powder.

I can't stand the fact that we have to go back to the Lower Monastery in order to fetch those damn "special weapons" after getting hold of the Wheel Key - thanks, Lord Braffit! (We handed over an official signed declaration, it's okay!)
