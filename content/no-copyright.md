### No Copyright

Inspired by Leo Babauta's ["uncopyright and the minimalist mindset"](https://mnmlist.com/uncopyright-and-a-minimalist-mindset/), I decided to apply this to Jefklak's Codex. This is the same page as my master website at [Brain Baking](https://brainbaking.com/no-copyright-no-tracking).

I've always detested the _'this is mine!'_-mindset, especially when it comes to intellectual property. Everyone benefits if everything is open and everyone can build upon each other's work. A possible financial loss is not an excuse. Leo has found copyrights not to be particularly helpful, so he simply got rid of them. He sells thousands of ebooks monthly. You have the right to share them with friends. He would rather have you buy them, but this way his work reaches a broader audience. 

The source of this website is available at my [Github repository](https://github.com/wgroeneveld/jefklakscodex). Feel free to do with it whatever you want: copy excerpts, republish images, use code partials, rip the theme, ... There's a reason the repository is **public**.

Of course I would be really grateful if you would still attribute Jefklak's Codex as the source of your used material. However, I do not want to oblige you to do so using a confusing Creative Commons licence. 

### No Tracking

Who doesn't like cookies? I'm [a baker](https://redzuurdesem.be/) - I would know. Well, I don't like cookies on websites, because they rise privacy concerns. That is why, inspired by [Laura Kalbag's "I don't track you"](https://laurakalbag.com/i-dont-track-you/) philosophy, I do everything I can to _not_ track you, but to track **traffic** instead. 

I achieved this by ditching Google Analytics and hosting third-party libraries myself. So _rest assured_, Google does not know you were here! Instead, I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com), a simple and privacy-focused analytics system that is self-hosted. It does _not_ require any cookie and it's hosted on my own SSL-verified domain. 

When a YouTube video is embedded into one of these pages, it will run in "no cookie" mode. That means content will be served from youtube-nocookie.com, preventing Google from tracking my visitors. 

The commenting system I self-host is [Commento](https://www.commento.io), a fast, privacy-focused commenting platform. It does come with cookies if you decide to login, but again: it's on my own SSL-verified domain. 

### Material used on this site

All screenshots and images related to games are of course still copyrighted by their legal owner. Since most older games aren't that popular anymore, I took the liberty to rely upon Google Images to grab screenshots when I was not able to provide my own. 

The Jefklak's Codex theme icons come from the game **[Gobliins 2](/articles/gobliins2-review)**, an old DOS point-and-click adventure game made by [Coktel Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coktel_Vision). The French studio has been bought by Vivendi and parts of it gone bankrupt in 2004, so I have no idea if I'm free to use their sprites. The legal "abandonware" rights have always been a bit shady.
